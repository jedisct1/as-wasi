<!--- Short Description-->

A high-level AssemblyScript layer for the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).

[WASI](https://wasi.dev) is an API providing access to the external world to WebAssembly modules. AssemblyScript exposes the low-level WASI standard set of system calls. `as-wasi` builds a higher level API on top of the AssemblyScript WASI interface, at a similar level to the [Node API](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/).

## Installation

You can install `as-wasi` in your project by running the following:

`npm install --save as-bind`

## Quick Start

Example usage of the `Console` and `Environ` classes:

```typescript
// Import from the installed as-wasi package
import { Console, Environ } from "as-wasi";

// Create an envrion instance
let env = new Environ();

// Get the HOME Environment variable
let home = env.get("HOME")!;

// Log the HOME string to stdout
Console.log(home);
```

## Reference API Docs

Reference API documentation can be found in [REFERENCE_API_DOCS](./REFERENCE_API_DOCS.md).

## Projects using as-wasi

* [wasmboy](https://github.com/torch2424/wasmboy) - Game Boy / Game Boy Color Emulator Library, üéÆwritten for WebAssembly using AssemblyScript. üöÄ
* [wasmerio/io-devices-lib](https://github.com/wasmerio/io-devices-lib) - Library for interacting with the Wasmer Experimental IO Devices API. Uses WASI for outputting graphics in a framebuffer, and handles mouse/keyboard input.
* [wasm-by-example](https://github.com/torch2424/wasm-by-example) - Wasm By Example is a website with a set of hands-on introduction examples and tutorials for WebAssembly (Wasm). Wasm By Example features `as-wasi` by default for the AssemblyScript WASI examples.
* [wasm-matrix](https://github.com/torch2424/wasm-matrix) - A Matrix effect in your terminal using AssemblyScript üöÄ and WASI üß© . THhise project is a bit older, and uses an older version of `as-wasi`, but still creates a cool effect!
